About this repository
---------------------

This is a re-engineered version of the Multi-Node AIO Cobbler has been removed
and replaced with Ansible to do the deploy of the KVM virtual machines. With time the intent here is to
replace the bash which deploys this all with Ansible.

Trusty will not be supported.
